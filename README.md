## Folder Structure

After creating an app, it should look something like:

```
.
├── README.md
├── components
│   ├── head.js
│   └── nav.js
├── next.config.js
├── node_modules
│   ├── [...]
├── package.json
├── pages
│   └── index.js
├── static
│   └── favicon.ico
└── yarn.lock
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.

See the section in Next docs about [deployment](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/Deployment) for more information.

```
## Deploy to Now

[now](https://zeit.co/now) offers a zero-configuration single-command deployment.

1.  Install the `now` command-line tool either via the recommended [desktop tool](https://zeit.co/download) or via node with `npm install -g now`.

2.  Run `now` from your project directory. You will see a **now.sh** URL in your output like this:

    ```
    > Ready! https://your-project-dirname-tpspyhtdtk.now.sh (copied to clipboard)
    ```

    Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app.

You can find more details about [`now` here](https://zeit.co/now).
